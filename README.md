# Joke Battle

**Joke Battle** is a fun interactive web app where two dad jokes face off and you get to decide which one is funnier!  
Each time you vote, the winner becomes the new **Champion**, while a new **Challenger** appears to compete for the crown.  

## Features

- Fetches random dad jokes using the [icanhazdadjoke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api)
- Vote between two jokes to determine the champion
- Displays the current champion’s **winning streak**
- Simple, responsive, and mobile-friendly design
- Clean and minimal UI built with vanilla **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**

## How It Works

1. The app fetches two random dad jokes when it loads.  
2. You choose which one is funnier, the **Champion** or the **Challenger**.  
3. If the Challenger wins, they take over the Champion spot and reset the streak to 1.  
4. If the Champion wins, their streak increases by 1.  

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — Structure and content  
- **CSS3** — Styling and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — Logic, event handling, and API integration  
- **icanhazdadjoke API** — Source of all the dad jokes
